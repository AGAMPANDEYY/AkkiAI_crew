finding_target_audience:
  description: >
    You are tasked with generating a detailed list of target audience segments
    for a business based on the provided information.  Your goal is to create a
    comprehensive and specific list that will help the business focus its
    marketing efforts effectively. First, you will be given details about the
    business and a description of its products, services, or solutions. Read
    this information carefully: <business_details> {{BUSINESS_DETAILS}}
    </business_details>

    <product_description> {{PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION}} </product_description>

    Now, follow these steps to generate the target audience list:

    1. Analyze the business details and product description thoroughly. Consider
    the industry, market positioning, unique selling points, and any specific
    problems the product or service solves.

    2. Based on your analysis, identify potential customer segments that would
    benefit from or be interested in the product or service. Consider factors
    such as:
      - Demographics (age, gender, income level, education, occupation)
      - Psychographics (lifestyle, values, interests, attitudes)
      - Behavioral characteristics (purchasing habits, brand loyalty, usage rate)
      - Geographic location (if relevant)

    3. For each identified segment, think about specific sub-segments or niches
    that could be targeted. Be as detailed and specific as possible.

    4. Consider both primary and secondary target audiences. Primary audiences
    are those most likely to purchase or use the product/service, while
    secondary audiences might influence the decision-makers or benefit
    indirectly.

    5. Ensure that each target audience segment is relevant to the business and
    product/service offered.

    Remember to be as detailed and specific as possible when describing each
    audience segment.  Avoid broad, generic categories and instead focus on
    well-defined niches that align closely with the business and its offerings. 
    Aim to provide at least 3-5 primary audience segments and 2-3 secondary
    audience segments, but adjust based on the complexity and scope of the
    business
  expected_output: >
    Present your target audience list in the following format:
    <target_audience_list> 1. [Primary Audience Segment 1]
      - Specific characteristics
      - Reasons why this segment is a good fit

    2. [Primary Audience Segment 2]
      - Specific characteristics
      - Reasons why this segment is a good fit

    [Continue with additional primary segments as needed]

    Secondary Audiences: 1. [Secondary Audience Segment 1]
      - Specific characteristics
      - Reasons why this segment is relevant

    2. [Secondary Audience Segment 2]
      - Specific characteristics
      - Reasons why this segment is relevant

    [Continue with additional secondary segments as needed]

    You are tasked with creating a brief statement using the Jobs to be Done
    (JTBD) framework to summarize the main "job" a  given
    product/service/solution helps customers accomplish, and why they would
    "hire" this product/service/solution over other options. You will be
    provided with the following information:

    <business_details> {{BUSINESS_DETAILS}} </business_details>

    <product_description> {{PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION}} </product_description>

    <target_audience> - Target audience details will be provided from the output
    of the `finding_target_audience` task. </target_audience>

    <buyer_persona> - Buyer persona details will be provided from the output of
    the `creating_buyer_persona` task. </buyer_persona>

    The Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework focuses on understanding the underlying
    motivations and desired outcomes that drive customers to "hire" a product or
    service. Instead of focusing solely on product features, JTBD emphasizes the
    progress that customers are trying to make in their lives.

    To create the JTBD statement, follow these steps:

    1. Carefully review all the provided information about the business,
    product/service, target audience, and buyer persona.

    2. Answer the following five key questions based on the information
    provided. Use your analytical skills to infer answers if they are not
    explicitly stated in the inputs. Write your answers inside <analysis> tags.

      a. What is the main "job" the customer is trying to accomplish by using this product/service?
      b. What problem or pain point is the customer trying to solve with this product/service?
      c. What outcome does the customer hope to achieve after using this product/service?
      d. What obstacles or frustrations does the customer experience while trying to get this job done?
      e. Why would a customer choose this product over alternatives?

    3. Based on your analysis, create a brief JTBD statement that summarizes:
      - The main "job" the product/service helps customers accomplish
      - Why customers would "hire" this product/service over other options
  expected_output: >

    Your final output should be structured as follows: <analysis> [Your answers
    to the five key questions] </analysis>

    <jtbd_statement> [Your brief JTBD statement, no more than 2-3 sentences]
    </jtbd_statement>

    Remember to focus on the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the
    job, and highlight what  makes this product/service uniquely suited to help
    customers accomplish their goals.

  description: >
    You are tasked with conducting a Stages of Awareness analysis based on the
    provided information about a target audience, buyer persona, motivations and
    desired outcomes, business details, and product/service/solutions details.
    The Stages of Awareness concept, developed by Eugene Schwartz, helps
    understand how aware potential customers are of their problems and the
    available solutions. Here is the information you'll be working with:

    <target_audience> - Target audience details will be provided from the output
    of the `finding_target_audience` task. </target_audience>

    <buyer_persona> - Buyer persona details will be provided from the output of
    the `creating_buyer_persona` task. </buyer_persona>

    from the output of the 'analysing_jtbd' task </motivations_outcomes>

    <business_details> {{BUSINESS_DETAILS}} </business_details>

    <product_description> {{PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION}} </product_description>

    Using this information, analyze the target audience's awareness level across
    the following stages:

    1. Unaware: The audience doesn't know they have a problem. 2. Problem Aware:
    They know they have a problem but don't know there's a solution. 3. Solution
    Aware: They know a solution exists but don't know about the specific
    product/service. 4. Product Aware: They know about the product/service but
    aren't sure if it's right for them. 5. Most Aware: They know a lot about the
    product/service and are almost ready to buy.

    For each stage, consider: - What percentage of the target audience might be
    in this stage? - What key messages or information would resonate with people
    in this stage? - What marketing channels or tactics might be most effective
    for reaching people in this stage?

      - Look for similarities and differences in TGs across documents
      - Compare how the Personas align with the business details and product/services
      - Evaluate how the Jobs-to-be-done relate to the business offerings

    3. Recommend priorities for targeting TGs:
      - Based on your analysis, rank the TGs in order of priority for lead generation
      - Provide a brief justification for each ranking

    4. Evaluate if any TG should be dropped:
      - Determine if any TG would require lead generation efforts that diverge too much from other TGs
      - If so, recommend dropping this TG and explain your reasoning
