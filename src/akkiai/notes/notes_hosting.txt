Test code and run on local

1. cd src/akkiai/app
2. "uvicorn", "src.akkiai.main2:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"
3. uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
4. go to local host since for testing 0.0.0.0:8000 will NOT work so use : http://localhost:8000/docs

EC2 Instance connect and run the codes (https://youtu.be/qNIniDftAcU?si=GbBcpq2xFpFZETPe)

1. Build a docker image docker build -t akkiai_v1-image .
2. Run the docker image in a container docker run -d (detached mode) -p 8000:8000 akkiai_v1-image 
3. to re run and check other dockers use docker ps 
4. remove some docker container using docker rm <container  id>
AWS-Linux terminal (STEP 1-6 for the first time)
1. sudo yum update -y 
2. sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
3. sudo service docker start
4. sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user (modifying user permission for ec2 instance)
5.pwd
6. mkdir downloads
7. cd downloads 

When pushing dockerfile change the relative paths 

Upload the local files to the ec2 instances (using pem file)
1.Run the following command in your local terminal (VsCode Git Bash)
2.chmod 600 ec2-akkiai-key.pem
3.scp -i ec2-akkiai-key.pem Dockerfile main2.py crew.py (all local relevangt files) ec2-user@3.87.154.144:/home/ec2-user/downloads <path so use pwd and get > (Public IP after @)
 scp -i ec2-akkiai-key.pem -r src/akkiai/app/config/task/* ec2-user@3.87.154.144:/home/ec2-user/downloads/config/task--> sdning files from a folder add -r tag 
4.Now build the docker image in the AWS-Linux terminal with commands
5. sudo docker build -t image_name .

MoM 21st 

1. Kickoff_id should  be shown immediately 
2. Agent def agent_name shoudl be same as the agent name defined in the agents.yaml config
3. Create 4 crews basically 4 different crew classes 
4. We need to normalise agent names 
5. taking inputs--- take inputs based on each crew (no need to take N number of inputs only inputs relevant to 
the crew)

MoM 22nd 

1. New set of prompts and agents for new flows 
2. One thing to do is when we are running crew, the crew is submit a job to anthropic using our api (Crew code how they 
are calling anthropic api)
3. What is the job id from crew? It is given by anthropic api when crew calls it --- find it out 
4. How crew and anthropic call interact each other? (We will just be keeping that job id)
5. Taking human inputs in between crew runs how to do that? make endpoint ffrom the github function for human input  


MoM 2nd Jan 2025

1. Agent configuration file issue is there check why and correct it.
2. How to train agents to get context (Research work) 
3. Agents should not hallucinate what to do Research
4. Explore crewai training. 
5. What will be the benefit of training faster ya better response? 
6. In general there are some example prompts to prevent hallucination.

MoM 11th Jan 25
1. bind it to IP jis ip se call aa rahi usi ip ka accept karna
2. pass only api key to header and not secret 
3. woh secret key ko use karke headings
4. soln_id, inputs, hash 
5. data 123 key abc secret key is with me and you have the key at server 
6. generate hash xyz at frontend mujhe bheja 123 and xyz and i have to check 
7. us api key ka secret key (private key), use secret key to encrypt and decrypt
8. header me sirf api key hoga
9. run me post call me hash input lena (sol id , input123 and hash)
10. use inputs and hashing function to use with the secret key to generate  new hash compare it with the hash passed from thr frontend
