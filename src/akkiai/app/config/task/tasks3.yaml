    You are tasked with conducting a Stages of Awareness analysis based on the provided information about a target audience, buyer persona, motivations and desired outcomes, business details, and product/service/solutions details. The Stages of Awareness concept, developed by Eugene Schwartz, helps understand how aware potential customers are of their problems and the available solutions.

    Here is the information of the startup you'll be working with:

    <startup_info>
    {STARTUP_INFO}
    </startup_info>

    Using this information, analyze the target audience's awareness level across the following stages:

    1. Unaware: The audience doesn't know they have a problem.
    2. Problem Aware: They know they have a problem but don't know there's a solution.
    3. Solution Aware: They know a solution exists but don't know about the specific product/service.
    4. Product Aware: They know about the product/service but aren't sure if it's right for them.
    5. Most Aware: They know a lot about the product/service and are almost ready to buy.

    For each stage, consider:
    - What percentage of the target audience might be in this stage?
    - What key messages or information would resonate with people in this stage?
    - What marketing channels or tactics might be most effective for reaching people in this stage?
    Ensure that your analysis is thorough, insightful, and directly relates to the provided information about the 
    target audience, buyer persona, motivations, business, and product/service details.
