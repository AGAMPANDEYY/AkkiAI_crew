    You are tasked with creating a brief statement using the Jobs to be Done
    (JTBD) framework to summarize the main "job" a  given
    product/service/solution helps customers accomplish, and why they would
    "hire" this product/service/solution over other options. You will be
    provided with the following information and the buyer persona from the previous task output:

    <startup_info>
    {STARTUP_INFO}
    </startup_info>

    The Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework focuses on understanding the underlying
    motivations and desired outcomes that drive customers to hire a product or
    service. Instead of focusing solely on product features, JTBD emphasizes the
    progress that customers are trying to make in their lives.

    To create the JTBD statement, follow these steps:

    1. Carefully review all the provided information about the business,
    product/service, target audience, and buyer persona.

    2. Answer the following five key questions based on the information
    provided. Use your analytical skills to infer answers if they are not
    explicitly stated in the inputs.

      a. What is the main "job" the customer is trying to accomplish by using this product/service?
      b. What problem or pain point is the customer trying to solve with this product/service?
      c. What outcome does the customer hope to achieve after using this product/service?
      d. What obstacles or frustrations does the customer experience while trying to get this job done?
      e. Why would a customer choose this product over alternatives?

    3. Based on your analysis, create a brief JTBD statement that summarizes:
      - The main "job" the product/service helps customers accomplish
      - Why customers would "hire" this product/service over other options
    Remember to focus on the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the
    job, and highlight what  makes this product/service uniquely suited to help
    customers accomplish their goals.

analysing_stages_of_awareness:
  description: >
    You are tasked with conducting a Stages of Awareness analysis based on the
    provided information about a target audience, buyer persona, motivations and
    desired outcomes, business details, and product/service/solutions details.
    The Stages of Awareness concept, developed by Eugene Schwartz, helps
    understand how aware potential customers are of their problems and the
    available solutions. Here is the information you'll be working with:

    <startup_info>
    {STARTUP_INFO}
    </startup_info>

    <buyer_persona> - Buyer persona details will be provided from the output of
    the `creating_buyer_persona` task. </buyer_persona>

    <motivations_outcomes> - JTBD motivation framework details will be provided
    from the output of the 'analysing_jtbd' task </motivations_outcomes>

    Using this information, analyze the target audience's awareness level across
    the following stages:

    1. Unaware: The audience doesn't know they have a problem. 2. Problem Aware:
    They know they have a problem but don't know there's a solution. 3. Solution
    Aware: They know a solution exists but don't know about the specific
    product/service. 4. Product Aware: They know about the product/service but
    aren't sure if it's right for them. 5. Most Aware: They know a lot about the
    product/service and are almost ready to buy.

    For each stage, consider: - What percentage of the target audience might be
    in this stage? - What key messages or information would resonate with people
    in this stage? - What marketing channels or tactics might be most effective
    for reaching people in this stage?
    Ensure that your analysis is thorough, insightful, and directly relates to
    the provided information about the target audience, buyer persona,
    motivations, business, and product/service details.
