    <value_proposition>
    {VALUE_PROPOSITION}
    </value_proposition>

    <messaging>
    {MESSAGING}
    </messaging>

    Your goal is to create the best possible accelerator pitch deck using this information. Follow these guidelines:

    1. Create 10 slides that can be presented in 20 minutes.
    2. Use a 30-point font size to ensure readability.
    3. Focus on creating a narrative that resonates with the audience and clearly communicates the startup's value.
    4. Include data visualizations where possible.
    5. Maintain consistent visual language throughout.

    12. Create versions with and without detailed technical specifications.
    13. Include editable charts and graphs.

    4. Consider how to visualize key data points for each slide.
    5. Plan each slide, considering the startup's USPs, messaging styles, and how to effectively communicate the value proposition.

    After your analysis, present your final pitch deck within <pitch_deck> tags, with each slide enclosed in its own numbered slide tags (e.g., <Slide_1>, <Slide_2>, etc.). Include your reasoning for the content and structure of each slide.
  expected_output: >-
    <pitch_deck_planning>
