Test code and run on local

1. cd src/akkiai/
2. "uvicorn", "src.akkiai.main2:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"
3. uvicorn main2:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
4. go to local host since for testing 0.0.0.0:8000 will NOT work so use : http://localhost:8000/docs

EC2 Instance connect and run the codes (https://youtu.be/qNIniDftAcU?si=GbBcpq2xFpFZETPe)

1. Build a docker image docker build -t akkiai_v1-image .
2. Run the docker image in a container docker run -d (detached mode) -p 8000:8000 akkiai_v1-image 
3. to re run and check other dockers use docker ps 
4. remove some docker container using docker rm <container  id>
AWS-Linux terminal (STEP 1-6 for the first time)
1. sudo yum update -y 
2. sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
3. sudo service docker start
4. sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user (modifying user permission for ec2 instance)
5.pwd
6. mkdir downloads
7. cd downloads 

When pushing dockerfile change the relative paths 

Upload the local files to the ec2 instances (using pem file)
1.Run the following command in your local terminal (VsCode Git Bash)
2.chmod 600 akkiai_v1_kp.pem
3.scp -i akkiai_v1_kp.pem Dockerfile main2.py crew.py (all local relevangt files) ec2-user@16.170.251.94:/home/ec2-user/downloads <path so use pwd and get > (Public IP after @)
4.Now build the docker image in the AWS-Linux terminal with commands
5. sudo docker build -t image_name .
